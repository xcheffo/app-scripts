This is a Test
==============

We can upload documents in *different* formats on github for **free**. By default, the domain name is `github.io`, but we can [use our own domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
This page is prepared using Markdown - the simple markup language used by github and trello. This language can also be used to typeset the documentation too.

The documentation can be uploaded in a `/docs` folder. Everybody has a read-only access to the uploaded files, while only authorized personnel can upload, change or delete.
