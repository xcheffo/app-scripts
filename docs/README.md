This is a Test
==============

We can upload documents in *different* formats on github for **free**. By default, the domain name is `companyname.github.io/repository-name`, but we can [use our own domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
This page is prepared using Markdown - the simple markup language used by github and trello. This language can also be used to typeset the documentation too.

The documentation can be uploaded in a `/docs` folder. Everybody has a read-only access to the uploaded files, while only authorized personnel can upload, change or delete. The pages are static - meaning no serverside scripting is allowed. Still, pages can be linked to [each](https://xcheffo.github.io/app-scripts/docs.md) [other](https://xcheffo.github.io/app-scripts/AUD-MAN-DanteController-4.7.x-v1.0.pdf).
